#### Gas
- Gas is the way that fees are calculated  
- The fees are still paid in either, though, which is different from gas  
- The gas **cost** is the amount of hours of labour, whereas the gas **price** is like the hourly wage you pay for the work to be done. The combination of the two determines your total transaction fee  
- if gas price is too low, no one will process your transaction  
- if gas price is fine but the gas cost of transaction runs "over budget" the transaction fails but still goes into the blockchain, and you don't get the money backfor the work that the labourers did  
- This makes sure that nothing runs forever, and that people will be careful about the code that they run. It keeps both miners and users safe from bad code!
